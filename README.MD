# pokedexcli

This is a project I built after completing the [Go course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/hody).

This is my first Go project!  
It's a command-line REPL PokÃ©dex.

In this project, I learned the basics of Go, as well as:

-   How to work with JSON (encoding and decoding)
-   How to make network requests
-   How to implement caching
